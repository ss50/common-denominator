Common Denominator 1.0

A social network for connecting people meaningfully in an interest-centric manner.

===ISSUES===

For running the project, there seem to be some quick issues with sqlite3 - just needs a reinstall of the module.

===OUTLINE OF USER EXPERIENCE===

Current state:

Users accessing the main page of the website will see a login form and two buttons: log in and sign up.
Logging in with appropriate credentials takes the user to a private main page (detailed below).
Choosing the "sign up" option takes users to a page where they are prompted to enter the following information:
First and last name; username; password. Users also select their initial interests from a scrolling box where multiple options may be selected. Upon submitting accepted signup information, new users are taken to a private main page.

The private main page displays: 
the user's profile picture; 
below that, a navigation bar with four options: update info (allowing users to update their e-mail address and phone number);
add profile pic (to change their profile picture);
add location (to give location info via navigator.geolocation);
and logout.
Below that, a grid of the user's indicated interests is displayed.

Users may click on these cells to access the interest pages. 
Interest pages then display thumbnails of people who have also indicated their liking that interest.
Hovering over these thumbnails displays the title tag, containing the user's name and the level to which they like that interest.
Additionally, users may search by name for other users who like that interest.



NOT LINKED DUE TO LACK OF TIME TO REINCORPORATE:

Users may also access pages at /interest/{intid}/add and /interest/{intid}/remove to add and remove interests directly.
Behavior here is buggy due to prior handling of these pages being linked to an older version of interest pages.
Accessing /interest/all displays a list of all current interests in the database along with a short description of each.
From this immediate page, there is also a link to add an interest.
On the add an interest page (/interest/addinterest), users may enter the name of an interest as well as a short description of that new interest.
Clicking "submit" updates the database with this new interest.
