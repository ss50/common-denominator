Common Denominator 1.0


Initial thoughts for SQL database layout:

_usr-logs (used for login purposes)
CHAR username PRIMARY KEY
CHAR pw-enc ( hash[hash(pw) + username] )?
---
_users (information on users themselves)
CHAR u-id : generate in some manner, six digit randomized and noncontiguous?
CHAR username
???? some sort of location information
CHAR intr : parsable list of interests indicated by this user
---
_interest: (information on interests themselves)
INT  int-id : numerical ID for the interest PRIMARY KEY
CHAR name : display name for this interest
?CHAR desc: a description for this interest
---
_int-memb: table of (interest-id, user-id) pairs
INT int-id : numerical ID, foreign key with interest 
CHAR u-id : user marking this interest 


Notes for future database design:
messages table:
CHAR m-id: message id
CHAR sender: u-id of sender
CHAR receiver: u-id of receiver
CHAR body: character limit on this
?CHAR relevant: list of interests
